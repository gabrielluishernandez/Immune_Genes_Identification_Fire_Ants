# The list of Drosophila immune genes was saved in input/Immune_genes-EPFL.txt comes from: 
# https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lemaitrelab/lemaitre-lab/resources/list-of-drosophila-genes-potentially-involved-in-the-immune-response/ 

# As this list have no-standar IDs, I had to download the NCBI Drosophila gene 
# information as this have the equivalences between the required identifiers:
# https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Invertebrates/Drosophila_melanogaster.gene_info.gz

# Add "\s" to ensure matching IDs in downstream commands.
# The -i option is for sed to edit the file in place and avoid creating a new file.
sed -i 's/$/\\s/' Drosophila_melanogaster.gene_info

#Extrac FlyBase identifiers of interest
