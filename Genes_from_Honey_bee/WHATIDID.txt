# Apis mellifera genes obtained form supplementary material from Accelerated 
# Evolution of Innate Immunity Proteins in Social Insects: Adaptive Evolution 
# or Relaxed Constraint? Brock, Amro, 2013.

# The gene names from Table S1 were searched in NCBI ->homology link-> OrthoDB v.10.1-> SI-gene id.

awk '{print $2}' homology_table.txt | grep "LOC" >> SI_ids_from_AM.txt

# For genes lis1 and spz, there was no result in OrthoDB 
# so I did a BLASTp for them in the SI proteins to get the ids.

#Create a blast database with the protein sequences from S. invicta
makeblastdb -in input/S_inv_longest_isoform.aa -dbtype prot -out tmp/s_inv_protein_db

# Run BLAST to obtain correct protein IDs from our data
blastp -db tmp/s_inv_protein_db -max_target_seqs 1 -max_hsps 1 -query input/apis_immune_genes.fasta -outfmt 7 > tmp/blast_results_domains.tsv
