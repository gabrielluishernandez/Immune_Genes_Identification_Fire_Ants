# Apis mellifera genes obtained form supplementary material from Accelerated

# The gene names from Table S1 were searched in NCBI ->homology link-> OrthoDB v.10.1-> SI-gene id.

# For genes lis1 and spz, there was no result in OrthoDB 
# so I did a BLASTp for them in the SI proteins to get the ids.
