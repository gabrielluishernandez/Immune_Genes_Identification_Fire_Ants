# The file input/Domains_asociated_AMPs.txt is a list of PFAM domains
# Associated with immunity, reported in 
# "Diversity, evolution and medical applications of insect antimicrobial peptides"
# https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0290 

# Scan the proteins of S. invicta to identifyt PFAM domains
# Download PFAM HMM database
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz

# Decompress and index the PFAM HMM database
gunzip Pfam-A.hmm.gz
hmmpress Pfam-A.hmm

# Run hmmscan
hmmscan -o input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.pfamscan Pfam-A.hmm input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.fasta

# Extract protein IDs that have the PFAM domains of interest:
grep -f -F input/Domains_asociated_AMPs.txt input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.pfamscan /
| cut -f1 > tmp/Protein_ids_result.txt

# To obtain stable gen IDs, take tmp/Protein_ids_result.txt and use it 
# as query for BioMart in Ensambl Metazoa.
# This process identified 15 S. invicta proteins with PFAM domains characteristic of AMPs in insects.
