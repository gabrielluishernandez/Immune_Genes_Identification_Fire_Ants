# The file input/Domains_asociated_AMPs.txt is a list of PFAM domains
# Associated with immunity, reported in 
# "Diversity, evolution and medical applications of insect antimicrobial peptides"
# https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0290 

# Scan the proteins of S. invicta to identifyt PFAM domains
# Download PFAM HMM database
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz

# Decompress and index the PFAM HMM database
gunzip Pfam-A.hmm.gz
hmmpress Pfam-A.hmm

# Run hmmscan
hmmscan -o input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.pfamscan Pfam-A.hmm input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.fasta

# Extract protein IDs that have the PFAM domains of interest:
grep -f -F input/Domains_asociated_AMPs.txt input/Solenopsis_invicta_longest_isoform.pfamscan /
| cut -f1 > tmp/Protein_ids_result.txt

# To obtain stable gen IDs, take tmp/Protein_ids_result.txt and use it 
# as query for BioMart in Ensambl Metazoa.
# This process identified 15 S. invicta proteins with PFAM domains characteristic of AMPs in insects.

###### AMPs in ants
# The following work was donw with information from: 
# "Comparative genomics analysis of five families of antimicrobial
# peptide-like genes in seven ant species". 
# In private communication I obtained the file input/AMP_from_S_invicta_Zhang.aa

#Create a blast database with the protein sequences from S. invicta 
makeblastdb -in input/S_inv_longest_isoform.aa -dbtype prot -out tmp/s_inv_protein_db

# Run BLAST to obtain correct protein IDs from our data
blastp -db tmp/s_inv_protein_db -max_target_seqs 1 -max_hsps 1 -query input/AMP_from_S_invicta_Zhang.aa -outfmt 7 > results/blast_results.txt

# Get the invicta IDs from the BLAST output
grep -v "#" tmp/blast_results_domains.tsv | cut -f 2  | sort -u > tmp/AMPs_in_S_invicta.txt

# Use Biomart to get Gene Stable IDs from Ensembl Metazoa
